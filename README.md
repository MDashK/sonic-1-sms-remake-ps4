# Sonic SMS Remake PS4

A port of the fangame **Sonic SMS Remake** for the **PS4**.

**Competition works! And you can even cross-play between versions PC/Android/PS4.**

Official PC and Android versions on: **sonic-sms-remake.blogspot.com**

**Highlights of the latest update:**

• Fixed major memory leak **(no more crashes! \o/)**
<br>
• 60 FPS mode!
<br>
• Lots of other optimizations

**Expected bugs and notes:**

1. Labyrinth underwater does not change the character coloring and super characters won't have the glow effect. (for some reason, the shaders don't work on the PS4?!?)

2. When saving, the game freezes for a brief moment. This is mostly noticeable when exiting options or switching between memory cards. BTW: You can delete a memory card using the square button.
